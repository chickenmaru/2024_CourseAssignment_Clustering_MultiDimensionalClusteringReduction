## 1.Flowchart 1: 
### (1) Open four_cols.csv and use the Data Table to describe the dataset content.
| Attribute Name | Attribute Meaning | Distribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `income` | Customer Income | <img width="2329" height="329" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d02ece4-1308-4105-ae8e-611b7950ea39" /> |
| `age` | Customer Age | <img width="2335" height="335" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6d644a4-f9e5-43b0-a64f-975ccc145ebd" />|
| `days_since_purchase` | Days Since Last Purchase | <img width="2294" height="316" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a3779e5-4fdf-4c59-b824-cc60ae225b2b" />|
| `annual_spend` | Customer's Annual Spending Amount | <img width="2384" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f744db5e-fcdf-441c-a0e9-b99d9145cead" />|

### (2) Use PCA to reduce the data to 2 dimensions, then plot in a Scatter Plot using the new dimensional space. Explain whether the plotting results can clearly show 3 clusters.
After using PCA to reduce the four-dimensional data to two dimensions, the generated scatter plot is as follows, where it can be clearly observed that the data mainly forms three clusters.

## 2.Flowchart 2:
### (1) Use k-Means with k=3, initialized with KMeans++, to cluster four_cols.csv, then reduce the data to 2 dimensions via PCA, and finally plot the clustered scatter plot using Scatter Plot (use different colors and shapes to represent data from different clusters).

### (2) Similar to the above, change k=4 and k=5 respectively, and plot the clustered scatter plots.
The figure below is the scatter plot for k=4.

The figure below is the scatter plot for k=5.

## 3.Flowchart 3:
### (1) Use the silhouette score evaluation method to select the optimal k value for k-Means, and explain whether the optimal k value differs from the number of clusters visualized in Flowchart 1. 
Using the silhouette score to evaluate the optimal k value, it is found that k=5 yields the highest silhouette score, which differs from the number of clusters observed in the visualization of Flowchart 1. The comparison chart generated from both visualizations is as follows.

### (2)Please use Box Plot analysis to examine the characteristics of each cluster under the optimal k value clustering. 
Under the condition of dividing into 5 clusters, the distribution of each cluster's respective attributes is as follows.
